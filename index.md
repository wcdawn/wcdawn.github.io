My name is William.
I am a nuclear engineer in Idaho Falls, ID.
My work and research interest are numerical methods for efficiently modeling nuclear power reactors, especially those with hexagonal geometry.

When I'm not working on research, I'm probably hiking.
The photo on the right is my dog, Annie, and me in Grand Teton National Park.
I'm also interested in computer science and software development and you can find some of my experiments detailed in my [blog](/blog) or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/wcdawn).
