A few weeks ago, I participated in the MFEM Community Workshop where I shared some of my research on solving the neutron transport equation in unstructured meshes using exascale computing architectures to model microreactors.
The workshop was a great experience and a great way to learn about new developments in MFEM, as well as how other researchers around the world are using these tools.
You can take a look at [this](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/newsroom/mfem-team-hosts-first-community-workshop) press release from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to see what other cutting-edge research is being performed with MFEM.
